    <Pre STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:GEORGIA"><H2 STYLE="COLOR:NAVY">    ->  Cloud computing is an emergent paradigm to provide reliable and resilient infrastructure enabling the users (data owners) to store their data 
          and the data consumers (users) can access the data from cloud servers.
    ->  This paradigm reduces the storage and maintenance costs of the data ownerAt the same time, the data owner loses physical control and possession 
          of data which leads to many security risks. Therefore, auditing services to check data integrity in the cloud is essential. 
    ->  This issue has become a challenge as the possession of data needs to be verified while maintaining privacy.
    ->  To address these issues this work proposes a secure and efficient privacy preserving provable data possession (SEPDP). Further, extend SEPDP to support 
          multiple owners, data dynamics and batch verification
    ->  The most attractive feature of this scheme is that the auditor can verify the possession of data with low computational overhead
